<a id="test-purpose"></a>
## 1 Test purpose

Verify human User Review, child Integration, and final merge gates as independent exact-subject records.

<a id="test-conditions-and-oracles"></a>
## 2 Test conditions and oracles

<a id="tst-ur-001"></a>
### 2.1 TST-UR-001 User Review identity and exact subject

**Setup and action:** Submit current and stale approvals from human, bot, and unrelated accounts; change HEAD, ADC, Readiness, feedback, and review-thread resolution between reads.

<a id="ora-ur-001"></a>
#### 2.1.1 ORA-UR-001 Expected result

Only a current human approval on the exact subject passes. Edits, deletions, stale state, incomplete pagination, or unresolved threads invalidate approval.

<a id="tst-ur-002"></a>
### 2.2 TST-UR-002 Feedback loops and host provenance

**Setup and action:** Exercise all four GitHub feedback surfaces, repeated/edited/deleted events, direct host approval, a quoted message, an attachment, and an unverified CLI JSON event. For PR conversation and diff comments, test the exact two-line `P-ASES-DECISION: CHANGES_REQUESTED` plus `P-ASES-HEAD: <SHA-40>` body, current versus stale HEAD, inline `commit_id` match, authorized versus unrelated human, bot, quote, malformed syntax, and ordinary natural-language requests.

<a id="ora-ur-002"></a>
#### 2.2.1 ORA-UR-002 Expected result

Only a current authorized human's exact, unquoted, whole-body decision on the current HEAD returns the same Issue/PR to execution. Inline `commit_id` must match. Bot, unauthorized, stale, quoted, malformed, and natural-language comments do not trigger the transition. Host events require verified current-user provenance; questions and unresolved threads do not approve.

<a id="tst-ur-003"></a>
### 2.3 TST-UR-003 Parent Integration evidence

**Setup and action:** Remove, duplicate, open, fork, unmerged, out-of-main, and cyclic child records; invert a dependency merge timestamp; alter a merge SHA; omit or stale the typed Verification/Acceptance evidence; supply a local-only PASS record; change or omit a source/check file at the exact main commit. For the legacy parent #26, omit an ADC pointer and verify the evaluator uses only the current approved child #31 ADC's unique pinned parent-contract declaration; reject duplicate declarations, a different source path/commit, an unapproved child pointer, or an unavailable pinned source.

<a id="ora-ur-003"></a>
#### 2.3.1 ORA-UR-003 Expected result

Integration passes only for the frozen native child set, exact dependency DAG, closed Issues, one merged same-repository PR per child, main ancestry, and matching typed evidence fetched from exact main. Local-only records, stale refs, or altered GitHub content fail closed.

<a id="tst-ur-004"></a>
### 2.4 TST-UR-004 Final Delivery separation

**Setup and action:** Vary User Review, GitHub formal review, Required Checks, branch protection, mergeability, and explicit merge authorization independently.

<a id="ora-ur-004"></a>
#### 2.4.1 ORA-UR-004 Expected result

Each gate must be checked separately. Final Delivery never authorizes or performs merge, release, Issue closure, or parent activation.

<a id="tst-ur-005"></a>
### 2.5 TST-UR-005 Parent User Review

**Setup and action:** With parent Integration blocked, verify no parent review session starts and `phase:user-review` is not set. With a passing fixed Integration subject, verify the parent phase moves from `integration` to `user-review`, an immutable session binds the parent ADC, six child/merge pairs, and Integration digest, and the first invocation returns pending. Then vary exact parent Issue decision subject, actor identity/type, session timestamp, comment edit/deletion, ADC digest, child merge SHA, and Integration digest. Confirm an exact current human approval is recognized, while approval never sets merge authorization or activation.

<a id="ora-ur-005"></a>
#### 2.5.1 ORA-UR-005 Expected result

Parent User Review starts only after exact Integration PASS. Only a new whole-body `P-ASES-DECISION: APPROVED` plus `P-ASES-SUBJECT: <SHA-256>` parent Issue comment from the authenticated human can approve. Stale, edited, deleted, incomplete, or changed-subject decisions fail closed. Approval leaves parent close, activation, merge, and release as separate gates.
