# Delivery control

## Owner and inputs

Owner: runtime/p_ases/delivery.py and gate_policy.py. Inputs are current PR identity, exact HEAD, final Verification and Acceptance, audit and review evidence, User Review, required Checks, branch protection, and explicit user permissions.

## Workflow

1. Read the gate policy for the Issue. Fixed Bootstrap Issues #27–#32 use the separate technical evaluator before activation.
2. Evaluate ordinary Review Readiness from current exact-subject inputs. Do not substitute Bootstrap technical readiness for normal product gates.
3. For final delivery, re-read User Review, GitHub formal review, Required Checks, branch protection, and mergeability.
4. Verify an already merged PR and closed Issue only with the finalize command.
5. Present PR number, exact HEAD, technical checks, risks, and intended order before any merge request. A successful check is not user merge permission.

## CLI

~~~sh
python -m p_ases delivery readiness 32 42 HEAD40 path/to/plan.json path/to/verification.json path/to/acceptance.json path/to/self-audit.json path/to/independent-review.json --repo OWNER/REPO --root .
python -m p_ases delivery bootstrap-check 32 42 --repo OWNER/REPO --root .
python -m p_ases delivery final 32 42 HEAD40 path/to/plan.json path/to/verification.json path/to/acceptance.json path/to/self-audit.json path/to/independent-review.json path/to/readiness.json path/to/user-review.json --repo OWNER/REPO --root .
python -m p_ases delivery finalize 32 42 --repo OWNER/REPO --root .
python -m p_ases delivery parent-migrate-labels 26 --repo OWNER/REPO --root .
~~~

Parent label migration is preflight-only unless the explicit apply option is supplied and authorized. Bootstrap review waiver does not waive exact identity, tests, current-head CI, provenance, or the user's separate merge permission.

## Failure handling and output

Stale evidence, missing required checks, wrong App ID, draft/foreign PR, blocked user review, or unavailable branch protection is not ready. Report the exact blocker and evidence refs. Never merge, tag, publish a Release, activate the parent, or close #26 under this Issue #32 contract.

Next owners: integration-validation supplies parent gates; user-review supplies current feedback. See the [delivery design](../../docs/design/workflow-design.md).
